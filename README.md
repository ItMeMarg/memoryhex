# UX
## Project Goals
Description.


### User Goals
- A game that is straightforward enough to enjoy while maintaining a sense of challenge. 
- Design that is neither distracting nor bland, but that keeps an attractive balance. 
- A toggle button so users can reference instructions/links as needed and then hide elements to limit distractions during gameplay.
- Gameplay capability on different devices. 
- A contact button so users can submit feedback.  

### User Stories
- As a user, I expect an entertaining game.
    > Susan, Seattle: * .*

- As a user, I expect an appropriately designed game. 
   > Soo-ah, Seoul: * .*

- As a user, I expect to be able to play this game on different devices. 
   > Eike, Frankf√ºrt: * . *
### Site Owner Goals
- game accessible for folks with differing visual abilities.

## User Expectations and Requirements 
Expectations | Requirements
------------ | -------------
Play instructions are thorough and make sense | Write and present instructions in a  clear, concise manner
Game maintains user interest | Include interactive elements, such as buttons and scrollbars
Contact Form works properly | Contact Form validation allows contact from users yet limits spam
Content is appealing and useful | Design is thoughtful, tested on various devices before deployment

# Wireframes
In the early stages of this project, I found drawing a rough sketch of layout and elements to be the most productive. The wireframes for this project live [here](#).

Before putting code to IDE, I used [Moqups](https://moqups.com/) to create example pages of features on [mobile](#), [tablet](#), and [desktop](#).
